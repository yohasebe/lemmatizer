lemmatizer
==========
Lemmatizer for text in English.  Inspired by Python's [nltk.corpus.reader.wordnet.morphy](orpusReader.morphy) package.

Based on code posted by mtbr at his blog entry [WordNet-based lemmatizer](http://d.hatena.ne.jp/mtbr/20090303/prfrnlprubyWordNetbasedlemmatizer)

Installation
------------
    sudo gem install lemmatizer
    

Usage
-----
```ruby
require "lemmatizer"
  
lem = Lemmatizer.new
  
p lem.lemma("dogs",    :noun ) # => "dog"
p lem.lemma("hired",   :verb ) # => "hire"
p lem.lemma("hotter",  :adj  ) # => "hot"
p lem.lemma("better",  :adv  ) # => "well"
  
# when part-of-speech symbol is not specified as the second argument, 
# lemmatizer tries :verb, :noun, :adj, and :adv one by one in this order.
p lem.lemma("fired")           # => "fire"
p lem.lemma("slow")            # => "slow"
```

Limitations
-----------
```ruby
# Lemmatizer leaves alone words that its dictionary does not contain.
# This keeps proper names such as "James" intact.
p lem.lemma("MacBooks", :noun) # => "MacBooks" 
  
# If an inflected form is included as a lemma in the word index,
# lemmatizer may not give an expected result.
p lem.lemma("higher", :adj) # => "higher" not "high"!

# The above has to happen because "higher" is itself an entry word listed in dict/index.adj .
# Modify dict/index.{noun|verb|adj|adv} if necessary.
```
